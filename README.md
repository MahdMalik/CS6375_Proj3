1. First, you will need to install certain libraries. Here are the following you'd need to install:

- pip install torch on CPU, !pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 on GPU / Google Colab

- pip install tensorflow

- pip install numpy

Second, you just need to run "runAll.ipynb" and see the magic happen. 

Additionally if you want to speed things up, I also have made code to run the program on Google Colab. It can be found at this link. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fbTIpg7ST7O-bHu-uPffAQJf4IDyAIdS?usp=sharing. It should be already connected to the right Github link from which it references the rest of the follows, so you only have on the Colab the file to run the correct methods. If it doesn't work, try running it in VS code.
